# Greedy-Matching
Drew casual inference to evaluate the influence of reform measures for a large IT company (Tencent).

Implemented greedy matching algorithm to match control group and reform group by minimizing Euclidean space distance of features, such as profit, group size and wage.

# People Analytics
It belongs to a new domain: People Analytics (PA). PA is a data-driven HR function recently emerged in worldâ€™s top high-tech companies. Starting from specific talent management questions, PA collects, integrates and analyzes data, and applies the result to human resource decision-making and practices.

As we all know, data science is powerful when it applies to different domains, such as Fintech, health analytics, NLP and so on. People analytics is a quite new domain and growing rapidly. It motivates me to learn more, find this dataset from Tencent and try to evaluate the influence of reform measures.
